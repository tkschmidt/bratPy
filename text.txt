Sample preparation for mass spectrometry. Dried peptide pools
were initially solubilized in 100% DMSO to a concentration of
10 pmol/µl by vortexing for 30 min at room temperature. The
pools were then diluted to 10% DMSO using 1% formic acid in
HPLCgrade water to a stock solution concentration of 1 pmol/µl
and stored at −20 °C until use. 10 µl of the stock solution was
transferred to a 96well plate and spiked with two retention
time (RT) standards. The first set of RT peptides (JPT Peptide
Technologies) consisted of 66 peptides with nonnaturally occurring peptide sequences (Supplementary Table 1). 200 fmol
per peptide was used per injection. The second RT standard
(Pierce, Thermo Scientific) comprised 15 13Clabeled peptides, and 100 fmol per peptide was used per injection. Samples
in the resulting 96well plates were vacuum dried and stored
at −20 °C until use
